I'm currently running in demo mode since the Groq API key isn't configured yet.

Based on your question: "${message}"

Here's what I can tell you:

â€¢ I'm a passionate data analyst with expertise in Python, SQL, and machine learning
â€¢ I love building interactive data experiences like this terminal portfolio
â€¢ I have experience with modern analytics tools and AI APIs
â€¢ I'm always excited to discuss data science and analytical projects

To enable full AI functionality:
1. Set up a Groq API key in environment variables
2. The AI will then provide personalized, context-aware responses

For now, try these commands to learn more:
â€¢ about - My background and experience
â€¢ skills - Technical expertise
â€¢ projects - Featured work
â€¢ contact - Get in touch directly`
